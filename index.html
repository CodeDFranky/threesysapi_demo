                                        What we have here is a demo application making use of our
                                        developed API.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Our API functions with either one of two endpoints: “/generate” or
                                        “/verify.”
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="page move-to-right">
                                        When you get to our web-app's main page, you will be greeted with two options:
                                        <div>
                                            <span>"Sign a document"</span>

                                        </div>
                                        You may choose from either but, we highly recommend to start with the "Sign a
                                        document"
                                        option.

                                        <p>
                                            First of all, we need to understand what steganography is.
                                            <br>
                                            As defined by Google, Steganography is, "the practice of concealing messages
                                            or
                                            information within other nonsecret text or data."
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Next, what is a Data Matrix?
                                            <br>
                                            A Data Matrix is a two-dimensional code of black and white squares or dots
                                            arranged in either a square or rectangular pattern, also known as a matrix.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Here is an example of one:
                                            <img src="./images/example-dm.gif">
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            So what is a Steg DM?
                                            <br>
                                            In layman's terms, a Steganographic Data Matrix is a DM with a secret inside
                                            of
                                            it. This secret is dertermined by our very own unique algorithn and is what
                                            determines the uniqueness of not only the DM itself, but the document it is
                                            placed on.
                                        </p>
                                        <span>What about the API?</span>
                                        <p>
                                            Now that we've established the very core of our API, the Steg DM, let us
                                            proceed
                                            once again to the API and the signing of a document.
                                            <br><br>
                                            The API will work to determine whether or not your document possesses the
                                            traits
                                            we look for when placing our signature.
                                            <br>
                                            If it does, then it will place a signature on the document, and return it to
                                            you;
                                            Otherwise, you will be prompted as what could be the cause of the issue.
                                        </p>
                                        <span>What about the Demo?</span>
                                        <p>
                                            1. Select a pdf file you'd like to have signed. For the document to be
                                            accepted, it must possess enough a uni color space in the area you have
                                            designated for the signature to be placed on. The Steg DM's physical size is
                                            akin to 1/2 inch so please keep that in mind when choosing a document. Also,
                                            the API will only place a Steg DM signature on the first page of any given
                                            document.
                                            <br>
                                            2. Select a location where you'd like to have the Steg DM to be placed on.
                                            <br>
                                            3. Submit.

                                            The API will work to determine whether or not your document is one that is
                                            valid,
                                            meaning it has been signed with our API's Steg DM, or otherwise.
                                        </p>

                                            1. Select a pdf file. Preferably one with a Steg
                                            DM but, you may choose otherwise to see what the API will respond with.

                                            2. Submit.

                                            3. The API will inform you, through the demo, whether the document you have
                                            submitted is one
                                            that is signed with our Steg DM and is original.

                                            3.1 You may be tempted to extract the Steg DM from a document and place it
                                            on another to make it valid but our API will catch this and notify you that
                                            the document that you have created is one that is falsified.
